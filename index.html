                                owing to a lack of space exploration. With a pressure of 93 bar and a temperature of 450
                                degrees Celsius <a href="#one">[1]</a>, such an environment is synonymous with hell. Due
                                to the extreme conditions, the landers sent to the venus's surface
                                could stand only a few hours running. Our key challenge in exploring Venus lies in
                                making reliable energy sources that
                                can withstand such severe conditions, as NASA has planned for a Long-Live In-Situ Solar

                <p class="details " bis_skin_checked="1">Considering energy requirements for a lander mission, the most
                    promising solution we discovered is a Low-Temperature
                    Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Fuel cells are an ideal candidate as, in comparison to conventional
                    batteries, they provide
                    higher power density, are scalable, and provide mass and volume savings for an extended period of
                    operation of landers.
                    A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that generates electricity through the continuous flow of
                    reactants. It is
                    extremely efficient because, unlike other electrochemical sources that must be converted to thermal,
                    mechanical, and
                    then electrical energy, it converts directly to electrical energy in a one-step process. It is a
                    conversion device that
                    works until fuel gases and oxidants are supplied to electrodes.

                        which is quite high considering Venus's surface
                        temperature. Therefore, we need to use a lower temperature SOFC that functions at the Venus

                <p class=".initial_details">
                    There are two major ways of cell design configuration.


                <ol class="mini_details">
                    <li>Planar</li>
                    <li>Tabular</li>
                </ol>


                The cells are designed in the planar configuration because of the higher power density(1.8-2
                W/cm<sup>2</sup>), lower
                manufacturing cost(US$800/kW). compact design and lightweight, less energy loss, and better mobility in
                comparison to
                the tubular configuration, which has lower power density (0.2-0.3 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and focuses on
                constraint design <a href="#five">[5]</a> . Moreover,
                the planar configuration can be designed in 3 styles. <a href="#six"> [6]</a>
                <ol class="mini_details">
                    <li>Electrolyte-supported</li>
                    <li>Anode-supported</li>
                    <li>Cathod-supported</li>
                </ol>
                <br>


                <p>
                    Among these, anode-supported configurations suit our needs the best. Cells built with an anode as
                    the support structure
                    have the advantage of having a thin electrolyte membrane. This dramatically reduces the ohmic loss
                    attributed to the
                    electrolyte thickness, which enables a lower operating temperature and higher performance. The lower
                    operating
                    temperature greatly reduces degradation (related to the corrosion of the ancillary reactant delivery
                    equipment and
                    adverse effects on the cell), thereby increasing lifetime. Additionally, this design has a thin
                    cathode layer that
                    provides an opportunity for tailoring the cathode material formulation to enhance performance or
                    provide chemical
                    resistance for various applications. A downside to anode-supported cells is that the nickel cermet
                    support must be
                    porous to allow for gas diffusion; thus, it is harder to seal the periphery. In addition, the
                    diffusion resistance of
                    the anode gases through this thick anode support structure makes it difficult to achieve high
                    single-pass fuel
                    utilization.

                    Single-cell can‚Äôt provide the required energy, so stack technology connects numerous cells in series
                    and parallel.
                    Therefore, we use interconnects made up of metallic alloy (Ferritic steel) with grooves for fuel and
                    oxidant flow to
                    connect one anode to another cathode. Gaseous flow is designed such that fuel is flown in contact
                    with the anode and air
                    is flown in contact with the cathode. And to prevent their mixing, appropriate sealants [name] that
                    can withstand the
                    temperature of Venus.[7]
                    Cathode, anode, and electrolyte are sandwiched on a glass plate. The airflow vent system is managed
                    with the help of
                    grooves of the plate, indicated by the red arrow as the fuel flows in contact with the anode; the
                    blue arrow as an
                    oxidant in contact with the cathode. Sealing glass to prevent the mixing of two gases.

                    Fuel cell compartment is placed below the main system vessel. Gaseous containers are in main
                    compartment and gases are
                    passed to electrodes through mechanical motors and valve system which are controlled to provide
                    intermittent supply.
                    Such system can operate in any orientation. Byproducts and unreacted gases are contained in
                    byproduct container and
                    released through two-door system to manage pressure difference. Fuel cell is contained in pressure
                    vessel made up of
                    Nickel alloy containing inert gas inside that prevents active components from corrosion and
                    pressure. But vessel
                    conducts heat to maintain operating temperature inside fuel cell compartment.
