                    Oxide Fuel Cell. Fuel Cells are the perfect candidate because in compared to conventional batteries,
                    they offer higher specific energy, scalable, provid mass and volume savings for extended period of
                    operation of landers. [1] . Fuel cell is an electrochemical device which generates electricity by
                    continuous flow of reactants. It is extremely efficient because unlike other electrochemical sources
                    which needs to be converted to thermal, then mechanical and then electrical energy, it directly
                    converts
                    to electrical energy with 1 step process. It is a conversion device which works until fuel gases and
                    oxidants are supplied to electrodes.

                <p class=".initial_details">
                    There are two major ways of cell design configuration.


                <ol class="mini_details">
                    <li>Planer</li>
                    <li>Tabular</li>
                </ol>


                The cells are designed in the planar
                configuration because of higher power density(1.8-2 W/cm^2), Lower manufacturing cost(US$800/kW),
                compact
                design and
                lightweight, less energy loss, and better mobility, in comparison to the tubular configuration which has
                lower power
                density (0.2-0.3 W/cm^2) and focuses on constraint design. Moreover, the planar configuration can be
                designed in 3
                styles
                <ol class="mini_details">
                    <li>Electrolyte-supported</li>
                    <li>Anode-supported</li>
                    <li>Cathod-supported</li>
                </ol>
                <br>


                <p>
                    Among these Anode supported configuration suits our needsthe best.
                    Cells built with an anode as the support structure have the advantage of having a thin electrolyte
                    membrane. This
                    greatly reduces the ohmic loss attributed to the electrolyte thickness, which enables lower
                    operating
                    temperature and
                    higher performance. The lower operating temperature greatly reduces degradation (related to the
                    corrosion of the
                    ancillary reactant delivery equipment and adverse effects on the cell), thereby increasing lifetime.
                    Additionally, this
                    design has a thin cathode layer that provides an opportunity for tailoring the cathode material
                    formulation to enhance
                    performance or provide chemical resistance for various applications. A downside to anode-supported
                    cells
                    is that the
                    nickel cermet support must be porous to allow for gas diffusion; thus, it is harder to seal the
                    periphery. In addition,
                    the diffusion resistance of the anode gases through this thick anode support structure makes it
                    difficult to achieve
                    high single-pass fuel utilization.

                    Therefore, we use interconnect made up of metallic alloy (Ferratic steel) with grooves for fuel and
                    oxidant flow to
                    connect one anode to another cathode. Gaseous flow is designed such that fuel is flown in contact
                    with the anode and air
                    is flown in contact with the cathode. And to prevent their mixing, appropriate sealants [name] that
                    can withstand the
                    temperature of venus.

                <p>Cathode, anode, and electrolyte sandwiched on a glass plate, air flow vent system is managed with the
                    help of grooves of
                    the plate, indicated red arrow as the fuel flows in contact with anode; blue arrow as an oxidant in
